# Simple and flexible version control and code syncing
# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Development Setup
Metro uses Go and requires `git2go` and `libgit2` to be installed.
git2go must be built and added to the `GOPATH`.
The project can be built easily using `go build`, but GoLand is recommended.

## Status and Future
Currently, some basic features are working, but not enough to be able to use in practice.
We're still working on various crucial parts such as syncing and deleting.

Once it's at a useable state, we plan to put work into an alternative Metro UI that allows easy control over repositories.
