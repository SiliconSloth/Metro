## Development Setup
Metro is written in C++ and uses CMake. It depends on libgit2 and libssh2 on all platforms,
and additionally OpenSSL on Windows and macOS.
For detailed build instructions, see the [wiki](https://siliconsloth.github.io/Metro/building/building.html).

## Status and Future
The basic functionality of Metro, including syncing, has been implemented, however it is not yet stable or user-friendly.
We are currently working on fixing bugs and generally improving the user experience.
