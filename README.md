***We are no longer working on Metro. All the major features have been implemented,
so you can try it out if you want, but it is not yet fully stable so use with
caution.***

## Development Setup
Metro is written in C++ and uses CMake. It depends on libgit2 and libssh2 on all platforms,
and additionally OpenSSL on Windows and macOS.
For detailed build instructions, see the [wiki](https://siliconsloth.github.io/Metro/building/building.html).

## Information

The latest version of Metro is alpha-1.1. You can download binaries from the
[Releases](https://github.com/SiliconSloth/Metro/releases) page, or build from source as above.
