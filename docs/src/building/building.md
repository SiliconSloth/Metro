# Building

Metro has been built and tested on Windows, Linux and macOS.
It depends on libgit2 and libssh2 on all platforms, and additionally OpenSSL on Windows and macOS.
It also requires [CMake](https://cmake.org) 3.10 or later to build on any platform.

The guides below will walk you through building Metro and all of its dependencies from source on each platform.
Alternatively you could install the dependencies via another method, such as your system package manager, however
these versions may be too outdated to work with Metro.
