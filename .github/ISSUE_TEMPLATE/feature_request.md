## Feature Description
Explain briefly what the feature is.

eg. The `metro sync` command will put your current changes into a wip branch if there are any on syncing

## Expected Behaviour
Describe how that command might be used

eg. Create a file on `master` without committing and sync. On remote, a new branch `master#wip` will exist with an addition commit "WIP" which contains the changes you have made.
