## Command Description
Explain briefly what the command does.

eg. The `metro commit` command will add the changes from the working directory and commit them with the commit message provided.

## Expected Behaviour
How the command might be used.

eg. You make some changes you want to save for later. Use `metro commit` to save them without needing to use `git add` or similar first.
